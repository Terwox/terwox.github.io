# Privacy policy

BGG Hard Block processes BoardGameGeek (BGG) data locally in the browser for one purpose: removing content from users the signed-in person has chosen to hide and, when enabled, keeping BGG's separate user subscription blocks aligned with that Hidden Users list.

The extension is inactive until the user reviews its in-extension disclosure and affirmatively agrees. If the disclosure changes, the extension requires agreement to the new version before processing BGG data again.

## Data handled

- BGG Hidden Users identifiers and the public BGG usernames associated with them
- discussion content and author attribution markup rendered on BGG forum threads, GeekLists, images, videos, files, and individual blog posts
- the current BGG page address, used only for local status reporting
- the signed-in BGG authorization value, used only in page memory to call BGG's own application programming interface (API)
- the user's subscription-linking preference and local status counts

The extension uses this data only to remove blocked posts, native blocked-user placeholders, and quotations attributed to blocked users; report local removal counts; and, if the user leaves subscription linking enabled, add missing user-level subscription blocks to their BGG account. It never removes a subscription block.

## Data storage

The extension stores the user's consent record, blocked usernames, subscription-linking preference, latest synchronization time, current-page removal counts, subscription-linking status counts, and latest discussion address in Chrome's local extension storage. BGG profile identifier-to-name mappings are cached in BGG local storage for up to 30 days to avoid repeated profile requests.

The extension's page code is limited to canonical HTTPS addresses for those six BGG discussion-page families. It does not inject on BGG's home page, game pages, collection, store, account pages, forum indexes, or any other site. Chrome treats host permissions as origin-wide even when URL paths are declared; the single BGG host permission is used by the background worker only to identify supported open discussion tabs for automatic refresh after consent or an extension update.

The extension does not store the BGG `GeekAuth` authorization value. It exists only in page memory while the live block list is synchronized and is never exposed to the extension's isolated content scripts.

## Data sharing

The extension has no analytics, advertising, telemetry, remote code, developer server, or third-party service. Terwox does not receive or have access to extension user data. Data is sent only to BGG/Geekdo endpoints that BGG's own frontend uses, over HTTPS, when necessary to provide the disclosed features.

## Limited use

BGG Hard Block's use of information complies with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. Data is used only for the extension's disclosed single purpose. It is not sold, transferred to third parties, used for advertising or credit decisions, or made available for human review.

## Retention and deletion

Local extension data remains in the Chrome profile until Chrome clears it or the extension is removed. Cached BGG profile mappings expire after 30 days. Removing the extension deletes its Chrome extension storage; BGG site data can also be cleared through Chrome's site-data controls. Subscription blocks already written to the BGG account remain under the user's control in BGG's native subscription-block editor.

## Changes

Material changes to data handling will be disclosed inside the extension and will require fresh affirmative agreement before the changed practices begin.
