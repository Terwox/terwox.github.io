# Dashboard Knowledge Retention

## Problem

Business intelligence dashboards are ubiquitous, but we know surprisingly little about how users actually process and retain the information they display. When someone looks at a dashboard, what do they remember? What factors influence retention? And can we measure engagement in real-time?

## Research Questions

1. How do users experience "flow" (optimal engagement) when interacting with data visualizations?
2. Can psychophysiological measures (EEG, heart rate variability) detect flow states during dashboard use?
3. What dashboard design factors correlate with better information retention?

## Approach

This dissertation uses a **mixed methods** approach combining:

- **Psychophysiological measurement** — EEG to capture neural correlates of attention and engagement
- **Behavioral measures** — Eye tracking, task performance, recall tests
- **Self-report** — Flow state questionnaires, cognitive load scales
- **Experimental manipulation** — Varying dashboard complexity, interactivity, and information density

### Theoretical Framework

The research draws on:
- **Flow theory** (Csikszentmihalyi) — Optimal experience when challenge matches skill
- **Cognitive load theory** — Working memory constraints on information processing
- **Dual-process theory** — Automatic vs. deliberate cognitive processing

## Status

Currently ABD (All But Dissertation). Data collection and analysis in progress.

## Why This Matters

Dashboards are a primary interface for data-driven decision making across industries. Understanding the cognitive and attentional factors that influence how people process dashboard information can inform:

- Better dashboard design guidelines
- More effective data visualization practices
- Training programs for dashboard users
- Adaptive interfaces that respond to user engagement
