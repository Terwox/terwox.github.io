# Dashboard Knowledge Retention

**Defense scheduled: March 2026** | Findings complete and analyzed

## The Problem

Organizations invest heavily in business intelligence dashboards, but a critical question remains unanswered: **What do users actually retain from dashboard interactions?**

This matters because dashboards aren't just for real-time monitoring — the insights users carry away influence decisions made hours or days later, often without the dashboard in front of them. If we don't understand retention, we can't design for it.

## Research Questions

1. What dashboard design factors predict better information retention?
2. Can we detect "flow" states (optimal engagement) in real-time using psychophysiological measures?
3. How do cognitive load and visual complexity interact to affect what users remember?

## Why These Methods

This research required **triangulating across measurement approaches** because each captures something the others miss:

| Method | What It Captures | Limitation Addressed |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **EEG** | Neural signatures of attention and cognitive processing | Self-report can't capture unconscious processing |
| **Eye tracking** | Where attention is directed, fixation patterns | Neural measures don't show what's being looked at |
| **Behavioral measures** | Actual recall performance | Physiological measures don't directly measure memory |
| **Self-report** | Subjective experience of engagement and difficulty | Objective measures miss the experiential quality |

No single method could answer the research questions alone.

## Theoretical Framework

The research integrates three complementary theories:

- **Flow theory** (Csikszentmihalyi) — Optimal experience emerges when challenge matches skill
- **Cognitive load theory** — Working memory constraints determine what gets encoded
- **Dual-process theory** — Automatic vs. deliberate processing have different retention profiles

## Approach

### Experimental Design

Participants interacted with dashboards varying in:
- Visual complexity (minimal vs. dense)
- Interactivity level (static vs. explorable)
- Information density (focused vs. comprehensive)

### Measures

- **Psychophysiology:** 32-channel EEG capturing frontal theta (engagement), alpha suppression (attention), and event-related potentials
- **Eye tracking:** Tobii-based gaze patterns, fixation duration, and areas of interest analysis
- **Behavioral:** Immediate and delayed recall tests, recognition accuracy, decision quality
- **Self-report:** Flow State Scale, NASA-TLX cognitive load, subjective engagement ratings

### Analysis

- Mixed effects models accounting for repeated measures and individual differences
- Machine learning classification of flow states from EEG features
- Gaze pattern analysis using scanpath comparison methods

## Key Findings

*[Results available upon request — happy to discuss in detail during interviews]*

The research identified specific dashboard design characteristics that predict retention, and demonstrated that real-time physiological monitoring can detect engagement states relevant to learning outcomes.

## Industry Relevance

This research directly informs:

- **Dashboard design guidelines** — Evidence-based recommendations for information architecture
- **Data visualization best practices** — When density helps vs. hurts retention
- **Adaptive interface design** — Using engagement signals to adjust complexity in real-time
- **Training program design** — Understanding how dashboard literacy develops
