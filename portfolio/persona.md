# Healthcare Persona Development

## Problem

Healthcare organizations often rely on demographic segmentation (age, income, geography) to understand their members. But demographics don't capture what actually drives healthcare behavior — attitudes toward medication, trust in providers, health literacy, and life circumstances.

The existing personas were outdated and based primarily on assumptions rather than data.

## Approach

I led a mixed methods research initiative combining quantitative segmentation with qualitative depth.

### Phase 1: Quantitative Segmentation

**Large-scale survey** administered to thousands of members, measuring:
- Health attitudes and beliefs
- Medication adherence patterns
- Communication preferences
- Trust in healthcare system
- Life circumstances and stressors

**Latent Profile Analysis (LPA)** to identify naturally occurring segments based on response patterns, rather than imposing predetermined categories.

### Phase 2: Qualitative Validation

**In-depth interviews** with members from each identified segment to:
- Validate that segments reflected real behavioral differences
- Understand the "why" behind the quantitative patterns
- Gather narrative detail for persona development
- Identify unmet needs and pain points

### Phase 3: Persona Development

Synthesized quantitative and qualitative findings into actionable personas including:
- Demographic profile (descriptive, not defining)
- Behavioral patterns
- Motivations and goals
- Pain points and barriers
- Communication preferences
- Design implications

## Key Insight

The analysis revealed that **attitude toward self-management** was a stronger predictor of healthcare behavior than traditional demographic factors. Members who saw themselves as active participants in their health had fundamentally different needs than those who preferred to defer to providers — regardless of age, income, or condition.

## Deliverables

- Persona documentation with behavioral data backing each characteristic
- Segment sizing and distribution across the member population
- Journey maps for each persona through key healthcare touchpoints
- Design recommendations for persona-specific communication strategies

## Impact

The personas were adopted by multiple teams across the organization to inform:
- Digital product design
- Member communication strategies
- Service design for pharmacy operations
- Content strategy and health education
