Mixed methods researcher who bridges quantitative rigor with qualitative depth. I turn ambiguous research questions into decisions: persona frameworks that product teams actually use, eye tracking programs that scale org-wide, and statistical models that predict real outcomes. 5+ years leading UX research at Cigna for specialty pharmacy products serving 500K+ members. Dissertation defense March 2026.
